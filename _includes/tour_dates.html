      This is a launch tour for our new partnership with the <a href='http://lighthouse-sf.org/' target='_blank'>LightHouse for the Blind and Visually Impaired</a>. We’re working together to create a whole new live show and radio series that presents the sonic experience of the blind. We’ll be releasing new radio episodes in January, and we’re scheduled to take the new show on tour in April 2019.
