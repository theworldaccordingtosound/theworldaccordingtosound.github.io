<b>Title: Development Coordinator and Manager</b>

<b>Introduction</b><br>
<a href="https://www.theworldaccordingtosound.org">The World According to Sound</a> is looking to form new partnerships with organizations interested in making, distributing, and promoting critical and formally innovative audio.

<b>Who We Are</b><br>
We (Chris Hoff and Sam Harnett) are a two-person audio team that collaborates with media outlets, arts organizations, academic institutions, and centers for the blind to make radio and live sound events. We produce a podcast, an 8-channel live sound event, a streaming listening series, and critical radio documentaries. The mission of The World According to Sound is twofold: to create experiential, immersive, communal sound events and to produce audio journalism that critiques neoliberalism and challenges the formal conventions of public radio.

In the last five years, weâ€™ve performed at more than 75 venues, received grants from California Humanities and the Zellerbach Foundation, guest lectured at 20 institutions including a semester-long residency at Cornell, formed partnerships with Meyer Sound and the LightHouse for the Blind, and worked with artists like the Kronos Quartet and Matmos. For a taste of the listening series, check out our interview on <a href="https://transom.org/2020/a-night-of-ear-candy-sam-harnett-and-chris-hoff/">HowSound</a>; and for an example of our journalistic work, you can take a listen to an excerpt of the <a href="https://www.kqed.org/howwegothere">How We Got Here</a> radio series.
